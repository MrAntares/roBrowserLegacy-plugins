# IntroMessage Plugin
- You must provide NEWS URL in RoBrowser Config when adding this Plugin!
- Requires PluginManager to be able to handle object params (just update it)!
- Your url must match RoBrowser's security. If you use HTTPS this url must also be HTTPS (no mixed content).

Example:

`IntroMessage: { path:'IntroMessage/IntroMessage', pars: { newsUrl: '<YOUR NEWS URL HERE>' } },`
